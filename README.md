**Project Reflection**

In the process of developing the Computer Science Department Website, I have learned:

-Effective ways to structure and present information for a departmental website.

-Importance of clear navigation for different user groups (students, faculty, prospective students).

-Strategies for maintaining a cohesive and visually appealing design throughout the website.

-Utilization of responsive design principles to ensure a positive user experience on various devices.

This project has provided valuable insights into web development for institutional purposes. I hope this website serves as a helpful and informative platform for our department's community.
